## Purpose
This is a website that lets you plan your trip, check an image of the location you're visiting and how's the weather like there.

## Data
It gathers data from three different APIs : Geonames, Weatherbit and Pixabay.

## To make my project stand out, I integrated :
- Specifying an end date and displaying the length of the trip
- Saving a trip or mutiple ones in a section
- The ability to delete those saved trips
- Using localstorage so when the user visits the page again, the info is still here
- Getting a pdf version of the Trip and the apility to print it
- The ability to plan trip including a to-do list in a text editor
